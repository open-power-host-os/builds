Build the best of OpenPOWER platform virtualization
***************************************************

Considering the speed of the development of new features, or even
Hardware is created in the OpenPOWER ecosystem, it's a challenge to
get them in the traditional stable GNU/Linux distribution scenario.

open-power-host-os/builds repository is an open source collaboration
effort that aims to help administrators to build and deploy the latest
and greatest capabilities in the OpenPOWER world through a build
script that provides software well packaged and designed for the
`Supported GNU/Linux distributions`_

Supported GNU/Linux distributions
---------------------------------

* CentOS 7.3 PPC64LE


Refer to `30. How does CentOS versioning work?
<https://wiki.centos.org/FAQ/General#head-dcca41e9a3d5ac4c6d900a991990fd11930867d6>`_.

Installation
------------

* Clone the repository

::

$ git clone https://github.com/open-power-host-os/builds.git
$ cd builds

RPM Based distributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Install epel repository (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux):

::

$ sudo yum install epel-release

* Install RPM dependencies

::

$ sudo yum install -y $(cat rpm_requirements.txt)

Settings
--------

* Add user to mock group

::

$ sudo usermod -a -G mock $(whoami)


Running
-------

* Build a single or multiple packages

::

$ ./host_os.py build-packages --packages kernel libvirt


* Build all software

::

$ ./host_os.py --verbose build-packages

Note the ``--verbose`` parameter to get all the log messages in the
console. Instead of the standard ordinary messages. Please see
``--help`` for more options.

::

$ ./host_os.py --help

or

::

$ ./host_os.py build-packages --help

* Build old versions

OpenPOWER Host OS 1.0 and 1.5 used an older CentOS (7.2) as base version.
To build one of them, do the following changes in this git repository
before building:

Update yum repository to CentOS 7.2::

$ sed -i 's|http://mirror.centos.org/altarch/|http://vault.centos.org/altarch/7.2.1511/|' mock_configs/CentOS/7/CentOS-7-ppc64le.cfg

Update distro version to 7.2::

$ sed -i "s|distro_version:.*|distro_version: \"7.2\"|" config.yaml
$ sed -i -E "s|  '7': (\"\./mock_configs.*)|  '7.2': \1|" config.yaml

Update build version to v1.5.0 or v1.0.0::

$ sed -i "s|build_version:.*|build_version: \"v1.5.0\"|" config.yaml  # use v1.5.0 or v1.0.0

Install rpm packages which were used in older build code, but are not anymore::

$ yum install -y bzip2 wget

Clean yum repositories cache in mock::

$ mock --scrub all

These steps are documented in
https://github.com/open-power-host-os/infrastructure/tree/master/jenkins_jobs/build_old_host_os_versions/script.sh .

* Build custom software

The build code keeps a cache of all packages source code (Git/Mercurial/SVN)
repositories so that they do not need to be downloaded on every build. If it is
desired to change the source code of a package, you may edit the package local
repository content. To build the package from this modified local repository,
either use a file:// URL pointing to it in the package metadata (YAML)
file or disable package repositories update in config.yaml.


Using the RPMs
--------------

We decided that's is a little bit intrusive to install all the
produced RPMs since some of them may not fit your needs. At the end of
the process you'll see a new ``result`` directory inside this
project's root.

A suggested set of packages tested is the following:

 - kernel
 - libvirt
 - libvirt-client
 - libvirt-daemon
 - libvirt-daemon-config-network
 - libvirt-daemon-config-nwfilter
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-interface
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-lxc
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-network
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-nodedev
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-nwfilter
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-secret
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-storage
 - libvirt-daemon-kvm
 - libvirt-daemon-lxc
 - libvirt-daemon-qemu
 - libvirt-debuginfo
 - libvirt-devel
 - libvirt-docs
 - libvirt-lock-sanlock
 - libvirt-login-shell
 - libvirt-nss
 - qemu
 - qemu-common
 - qemu-debuginfo
 - qemu-guest-agent
 - qemu-img
 - qemu-kvm
 - qemu-kvm-tools
 - qemu-system-ppc
 - qemu-system-x86
 - SLOF

You can use the following command to install, for instance,
kernel's RPM:

::

$ sudo yum localinstall result/kernel-4.9.0-4.el7.centos.ppc64le.rpm

Note that some of those packages are debuginfo which are recommended
in order to provide useful information for bugs in the case of any
failures.

Also no version is informed on the list above to make it valid even
for future versions with minor version changes.


Validating
----------

There is a whole repository dedicated to testing available at
https://github.com/open-power-host-os/tests

In order to run the build scripts unit tests or code linter, you will need to
install our development dependencies.

You can do this by issuing the command below

::

$ sudo pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

Running code linter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the root of the `builds` project directory, use the commands below to run
the code linter (Pylint):

::

$ PYTHON_FILES=$(find . -name "*.py")
$ pylint $PYTHON_FILES

Running unit tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the root of the `builds` project directory, use the commands below to run
the unit tests:

::

$ export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH
$ nosetests tests/unit


ISO image
---------

* Build Host OS ISO image

::

$ ./host_os.py --verbose build-iso

Please see ``--help`` for more options.

::

$ ./host_os.py build-iso --help
